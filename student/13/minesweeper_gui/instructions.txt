Opening a tile 
Game ends when a mine is hit, or all mines have been flagged. The info label at the top of the screen updates accordingly,
and the tiles lock.
The program can be closed with the "Close"-button
The game can be reset with the "Reset"-button.
There is a timer at the bottom of the screen, displaying the minutes and second since the game started.

There is a known error (crash) situation if the user inputs a string as seed, but fixing this was not required.
Almost all of my code happens in the mainwindow.cpp / -.hh. Tbh there were no design decisions, I just went by what worked.
